# GifTastic

This is a dynamic web page that populates gifs by calling the GIPHY API. Users can get started by clicking existing buttons or entering their own submissions, which will add new buttons that can also be clicked on to view additional gifs.

The theme for this site is basketball, which is why the background has basketball colors and the initial buttons are basketball players, but users can technically enter any subject available on Giphy.
